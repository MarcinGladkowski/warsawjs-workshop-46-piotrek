# WarsawJS Workshop #46

By Piotr Szlachciak

## Rules

1. Have fun
2. Ask a lot of questions

## How do I use this repository?

In this repository you will find two branches: `master` and `solutions`.
They are almost identical, but on `master` all of the function implementations
are missing and the test suites are skipped.

During the workshop you will run the test suites and implement the required
functions. If you get stuck just look at the `solutions` branch!
